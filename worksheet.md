# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  They are both repository websites created to store files and code for collaboration between people and also as a place for other people to suggest changes to code.
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
Matthew Roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
Dave Pearce made both first and last commits to repo B
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
Neither of the repositories are active recently, both having their last commits in August 2022. For repo A it looks as if they prepared for a release of their project, whilst repo B appears to have been stuck on a mystery exception error.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
Repo B has the most commmits with about 7950 commits

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
